Both my version and the instructor's version are the same, more or less. The exercise in the chapter mentioned telling 
the Virtual Assistant not to use with or try statements, so I took that to mean that the exercise didn't want me to use 
them either which is why I decided to make two versions of the same function. Even if this wasn't what the exercise was 
asking for, I think it was good practice because it helped me see how useful the with statements are since I didn't 
have to worry about where to put the .close() - something that gave me a bit of trouble in the first version of the 
function considering it needed to stay within the if-statement scope. That and the version with the with statements was 
much cleaner and easier to read.

Oops, I misunderstood the exercise and, consequently, ending up making a script that <i> almost</i> makes a Wordle game. 
So, unfortunately, my version only vaguely resembles the instructor's, so I can't really say which version is better. 
Though I can say that my version could use improvements. I'm sure there's ways I can trim down my code, but I also 
couldn't quite get the code to work the way I intended and I couldn't figure out how to fix it (entirely because I was 
doing way more than what the exercise was asking for, so that figures.) The problem I was running into was that
